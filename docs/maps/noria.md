# Noria

# Lorencia

**Noria**, the fairy homeland and kingdom, is a vast forest located at the far eastern edge of the MU continent. In the distant past, **Noria** was exclusively inhabited by fairies but over time,after Kundun's conquest of MU, contact and trade between fairies and humans increased. As a result, human presence and settlements in the region grew steadily.

**Noria** remains central to fairy life. Despite its seemingly peripheral location, **Noria** plays an important part due to its access to the East Sea and the underwater city of Atlans. The Chaos Goblin, which produces mystical chaos items and wings through its strange Chaos System magic, also calls **Noria** home.

Thus,fairy characters typically begin their journeys and careers within the forested realm of **Noria**, which acts as a gateway to many magical lands and secrets beyond.

## Portals

**Noria** acts as a hub, connecting several magical realms through portals. It contains two major gateways:

- One portal opens into the kingdom of [Lorencia](/maps/lorencia) which is a land inhabited by mystical creatures, situated close by.
- A second portal leads into the underwater city of [Atlans](/maps/atlans) that seems to be quite distant, given its underwater location.

These portals allow fairies, humans and other magical beings to travel swiftly between the vast forest of **Noria** and the lands beyond, facilitating interaction and exchange between the different magical realms. **Noria** thus forms a nexus at the heart of a larger magical network.
