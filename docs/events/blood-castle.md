### Blood Castle Quest

After teleporting to **Blood Castle**, talk to the wounded Archangel. He will tell you the story of his fall and the next coming of the monsters, which you have to defeat. The Archangel will challenge you to retrieve his holy weapon so that he can join the heroes of Lotus Mu in the fight against the troops of Kundun.

You are given 15 minutes for the entire quest. First, you will find yourself on the bridge, on which you will need to kill many monsters.
After killing the monsters and crossing the bridge to the castle gates, you will need to break the gates.
Once inside the castle, the first step is to kill the Magic Skeleton (2 sorcerers for one player, 4 for two players and etc.).
After the reprisal against the sorcerers, you will need to find the way to the statue, which contains the Archangel's weapon, through the labyrinth of blood, in which bloodthirsty, merciless monsters live.
Having reached the crystal statue, in the hands of which is the Archangel's weapon, you must find the strenght within you to smash it and take the weapon.
