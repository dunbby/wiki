## Game-play

### Preparation

At the beginning of each hour, the following messages start to appear in the Lotus Mu Server: "6 (5,4,3,2,1) minute (s) left before entry into Blood Castle ". As soon as you see such a message, go with **Invisibility Cloak** to the Archangel ~~(Located TBD)~~. Talk to him, on the screen you will see a table in which you need to select the appropriate level of Blood Castle for your character (the same level should be the Invisibility Cloak in your inventory). If you did everything correctly, then you will be taken to the **Blood Castle**.

### Blood Castle Quest

After teleporting to Blood Castle, talk to the wounded Archangel. He will tell you the story of his fall and the next coming of the monsters, which you have to defeat. The Archangel will challenge you to retrieve his holy weapon so that he can join the heroes of Mu Online in the fight against the troops of Kundun.

You are given 15 minutes for the entire quest. First, you will find yourself on the bridge, on which you will need to kill many monsters.
After killing the monsters and crossing the bridge to the castle gates, you will need to break the gates.
Once inside the castle, the first step is to kill the Magic Skeleton (there are 2 sorcerers for one player, 4 for two players, etc.).
After the reprisal against the sorcerers, you will need to find the way to the statue, which contains the Archangel's weapon, through the labyrinth of blood, in which bloodthirsty, merciless monsters live.
Having reached the crystal statue, in the hands of which is the Archangel's weapon, smash it and take the weapon.

Having picked up the weapon, return back to the Archangel, simultaneously fighting off the monsters. Now you just need to give the weapon to the owner.
