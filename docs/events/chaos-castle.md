## Game-play

### Preparation

The **Chaos Castle** arena is square shaped with sections of the floor missing. A character can fall off the edge of the arena. If a character falls off the edge of the arena, they are disqualified. Once the Entry Period has passed, there is a 1 minute delay before the event starts.

### Chaos Castle Quest

When started, monster will instantly spawn throughout the arena. Including other characters, there will be a total of 100 enemies in the arena. As enemies are killed, the Character Counter will decrease.

_Chaos Castle Characters_

Once the Character Counter reaches 50, sections of the outer floor will crumble. If a character is standing where the floor crumbles, the character will fall off the arena and will be disqualified.

Some of the monsters in **Chaos Castle** have a special Skill called **Explosion**, which causes strong Knock-back. Explosion (Range: 2) is only casted after the monster dies. The Knock-back effect of the Skill can cause characters to fall off the stage.

:::tip

Equipping **Ring of Fire** or **Pendant of Fire** can decrease the chances of the Explosion Knock-back (Elemental Fire Resistance). Using AOE Skills can also help avoid Explosion Knock-back.

### Event Completion

The **Chaos Castle** Event is won killing all other characters and monsters.
If more than one character remains after the timer reaches 00:00, the winner is determined by the amount of Event Points earned (Monster killed: +2 Event Points; Character killed: +1 Event Points).
