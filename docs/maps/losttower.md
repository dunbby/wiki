# Lost Tower

The towering edifice known as the **Lost Tower** stands proudly in the northern reaches of the MU continent. Once revered as a sacred shrine, its sanctity was desecrated following the merciless invasion by Kundun, rendering it a desolate wasteland.

[Kundun](/special-monsters/bosses/kundun), in his malevolence, has dispatched an assortment of horrifying creatures to occupy each floor of this foreboding tower.

At its summit awaits [Balrog](/special-monsters/mini-bosses/balrog), a sinister beast brandishing a menacing scythe, eagerly anticipating unsuspecting prey. Only a select few warriors within the realm of MU possess the strength and skill to rival his formidable might.
