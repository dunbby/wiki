# Devias

**Devias** is a snow-covered field situated north of the kingdom of Lorencia. Perpetual snow covers **Devias**, giving it a wintry appearance at all times.

Monsters inhabiting **Devias** are more formidable than those found in neighboring Lorencia or Noria. Only adventurers of level 15 and above are equipped to brave the monsters roaming **Devias**.

The guildmaster who creates and manages guilds also resides within **Devias**. This suggests **Devias** is an important location for adventurers, serving as a base for high-level guilds.

The cold, snowbound environment of **Devias** and its powerful monsters make it a challenging destination for only the most experienced adventurers. However,those who are up to the task are rewarded with the services of the guildmaster and likely other resources to aid their adventures.
