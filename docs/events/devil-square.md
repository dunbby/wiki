## Game-play

### Preparation

Prior to the start of the **Devil Square**, the following messages start to appear in the Lotus Mu Server: "Devil Square will close in 5 (4,3,2,1) minute (s) ". As soon as you see such a message, go with **Devil Invitation** to the **Charon** (Located TBD). Talk to him, on the screen you will see a table in which you need to select the appropriate level of Devil Square for your character (you should have the same level of Devil Invitation in your inventory). If you did everything correctly, then you will be taken to the Devil Square Event map.

Monsters will continue to spawn over 15 minutes. As the time progresses, the monsters which spawn will change and their difficulty will slightly increase.

### Event Completion
