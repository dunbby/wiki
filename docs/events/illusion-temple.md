## Game-play

### Preparation

Prior to the start of the **Illusion Temple**, the following messages start to appear in the Lotus Mu Server: "Illusion Temple will close in 5 (4,3,2,1) minute (s) ". As soon as you see such a message, go with the **Scroll of Blood** to **Mirage** ~~(Located TBD)~~. You need to have the correct Scroll corresponding to your Character's level in order to enter the Event. If you did everything correctly, then you will be taken to the **Illusion Temple** Event Map.

### Illusion Temple Quest

The arena is large. Here's a look at the layout of the zone.
You can see both teams starting positions on the westernmost and easternmost sides of the map.

![Illusion Temple Event Map](/img/events/it/it-map.jpg)

_Illusion Temple Event Map_

**Red team** and **Blue team** spawn on opposite sides of the map.

_Blue Team Skin_

The **Illusion Temple Ball** is located in either the northern or southern part of the map. Return the Ball to the team's **pedestal** to earn one Game Point.

When a ball is picked up, the character's Movement Speed will be decreased greatly so it's important for his or her teammates to work together to protect the ball carrier from the opposing team. Once a ball carrier is killed, disconnects or leaves the event the ball will fall to the ground and is able to be picked up by any player on either team.

The Illusion Temple Ball spawns on the **Pedestal**.

Each team's base also comes equipped with a **pedestal**, where players can bring back the event balls for points.

Once a ball is taken from the statue, they both disappear. They reappear again once a team returns the ball to their respective base.
